# Game Proposal
# WireFrame image 'img/proj1-wireframe.jpg'

		*Missle Command*

		Landing Page
		-Large header displaying title of game
		-Large 'PLAY' button centered on page to link to game page
		-Social Media share links under play button
		-Animated background
		
		Game Page
		-Use Canvas to build game space/animations/physics
		-Use Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation for objects including scoreBoard, missileCount, countdownTimer, and textScroll
			-scoreBoard keeps track of player score/round and displays updating numeric values
			-missileCount displays number of missiles left in any given round(either through numeric value or visual img count)
			-countdownTimer displays time left in given round
			-textScroll displays 'story' of game and feedback on player performance


# Project Goals
 My goal with this project is to learn how to incorporate a smaller, playable area on the webpage using canvas. I intend to use canvas only on the interactive area of the game page, while using vanilla JS DOM manipulation to build and structure the rest of the game page dashboard. Directly under the canvas element, I will build a text area with a scrolling 'story' to further engage the player, and provide feedback on performance to declare a win or loss. 
 Once I have a functioning desktop based game, I hope to use a media query to restucture the viewport to be mainly occupied by the canvas, and include a compressed dashboard to the right or directly under the canvas while removing the textScroll to provide more playable room.
